### Technologies witch were used:
* TypeScript
* React
* SCSS
* Web Local Storage

### Some issues:

1) ### `I faced with problem of loading lessons videos from remote API resource`
        Solution:  
        For all courses I used the same video link with purpose to show that i'm able to work with it

2) File .env includes only non-secret data.
(I suppose publishing token does not harm anyone in this case)
