### Used technologies are:
* TypeScript
* React
* SCSS
* Web Local Storage

### Some issues:

1) ### `I faced with problem of loading courses lessons from API resource`
#### Solution 
I used the same mock video link for all lessons with purpose to show that i\'m able to work with it

2) File .env includes only non-secret data.
(I suppose publishing token does not harm anyone in this case)
